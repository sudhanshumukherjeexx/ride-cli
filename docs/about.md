# About RIDE CLI

## Project Overview

RIDE CLI (Rapid Insights Data Engine) is an open-source data analysis and preprocessing tool designed to make data science accessible to everyone, regardless of their programming experience. It provides a user-friendly terminal interface for performing complex data operations without writing code.

## Mission

Our mission is to democratize data analysis by providing powerful tools that don't require extensive programming knowledge. We believe that everyone should be able to explore, clean, and analyze their data efficiently, regardless of their technical background.

## History

### From prepup-linux to RIDE CLI

RIDE CLI began as "prepup-linux," a tool initially developed to provide data preprocessing capabilities specifically for Linux users. As the project evolved, we recognized the need for a platform-agnostic solution that could serve users across all operating systems.

In May 2025, we rebranded from "prepup-linux" to "RIDE CLI" to reflect our commitment to cross-platform support and to better describe the tool's purpose as a Rapid Insights Data Engine.

### Timeline

- **2023**: Initial development of prepup-linux begins
- **2024**: Multiple release of prepup-linux with different analysis structures
- **May 2024**: Project renamed to RIDE CLI with enhanced features, menu driven approach, and cross-platform support

## Core Features

RIDE CLI offers a comprehensive set of features for data analysis:

- **Data Loading**: Support for CSV, Excel, and Parquet files
- **Data Inspection**: Explore dataset structure and content
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation analysis, distribution testing, outlier detection
- **Data Visualization**: Terminal-based plots and charts
- **Data Preprocessing**: Missing value handling, feature encoding, scaling
- **AutoML**: Automated machine learning model selection
- **Export Options**: Save processed data in various formats

## Technology Stack

RIDE CLI is built with:

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning capabilities
- **plotext**: Terminal-based visualization
- **numpy**: Numerical operations
- **termcolor**: Terminal color formatting
- **pyfiglet**: ASCII art generation
