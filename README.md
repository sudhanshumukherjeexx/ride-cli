## 📦 Installation

> **⚠️ Important:** Creating a virtual environment is highly recommended when installing ride-cli.

### 🔀 Upgrading from prepup-linux

If you're currently using `prepup-linux`, please follow these steps:

```bash
# Uninstall the old package
pip uninstall prepup-linux

# Install the new package
pip install ride-cli
```

### 💡 Setting Up a Virtual Environment

#### Windows
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv ride-env

# Activate virtual environment
ride-env\Scripts\activate

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

#### Linux/macOS
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv ride-env

# Activate virtual environment
source ride-env/bin/activate

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

### 📥 Using pip
```bash
# Inside your activated virtual environment
pip install ride-cli
```

### 🔧 From Source
```bash
# Inside your activated virtual environment

cd ride-cli
pip install .
```

## 💻 Usage

### 🎮 Interactive Mode
```bash
ride
```
or
```bash
ride-cli
```

### 📂 Loading a Specific Dataset
```bash
ride path/to/your/dataset.csv
```

### 📋 Main Menu Options
1. Load Dataset
2. Inspect Data
3. Change Data Type
4. Explore Data
5. Visualize Data
6. Impute Missing Values
7. Feature Encoding
8. Feature Scaling and Transformation
9. Export Data
10. AutoML (Train & Evaluate Models)

## 🎯 Interactive Workflow Example

1. **Launch RIDE:** ```ride```

2. **Load Your Dataset:** Choose option 1 and enter your dataset path

3. **Inspect Data:** Use option 2 to explore features, data types, and missing values

4. **Preprocess:** 
   - Change data types if needed
   - Impute missing values
   - Encode categorical features
   - Scale and transform features

5. **Analyze:** 
   - Visualize data distributions
   - Perform correlation analysis
   - Run AutoML for model selection

## 🤖 AutoML Capabilities
- Supports both Classification and Regression tasks
- Evaluates multiple machine learning algorithms
- Provides performance metrics
